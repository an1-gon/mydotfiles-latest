# **This is my dotfiles repo for my ArchLinux Setup**

## **Nvim**

For my nvim configuration I mostly configured it for note taking as well as a editor. Its a powerful part of my toolkit.
Take a look at my dotfiles/scripts section for my note system with nvim, tmux and markdown. This is the first stage of my configuration and 
will be subject to many changes over time.

My plugins can be found under dotfiles/nvim/lua/plugins.

## **Tmux**

Another great tool for multiplexing multiple terminal sessions, windows and panes. I really enjoy using it for managing my terminal apps.
check out my dotfiles/tmux for more

## **Markdown**

I use markdown for taking notes and styling using the markup language. I sync it to my phone using syncthing, obsidian and nvim. I will hopefully
be using this setup to push content to my blog in the near future but it is a nice workflow. All my notes are synced on my devices and I pay no fee.
I am planning to work on a script to push my notes to the cloud automatically with a timer. But on a later date.
